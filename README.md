# base-capture VCMP
Simple base capturing game mode. I coded this in late 2020 and this script was still a work in progress. This is not a complete script with all the features; it's quite simple because it is an abandoned work. If you want to continue my work or host this script in your own server, you're more than welcome. The only catch is you should NOT remove the author's credits. Let the credits stay if you want to use this script. Thanks for reading!
